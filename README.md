# Book-My-Car

## Overview
Welcome to the Book-My-Car! This project is a simple implementation of a car rental system using C++. It allows users to register, login, view available cars, make rental reservations, and get recommendations based on their requirements.

## Features

- Car Options: Users can view available cars such as Tata, Tesla, BMW, Audi, Lamborghini, Rolls Royce, and Electric cars (Ola S1, S1 Pro).
